    <td>(Student 4) Create a page that allows the user to view images. This page contains a form, 5
thumbnail images, and 2 pull-down menus (to select the page background colour and the
page text colour) and an area to display a larger image and associated description of that
image. When the user selects a thumbnail image, the corresponding large image and the
description of that image should display in the defined location on the form. You may use
onMouseOver or radio buttons to select the thumbnail.</td>
